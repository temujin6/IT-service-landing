            Hello! I am Temujin.S, a junior developer of Steppe Link LLC. I
            began working here from January 1st of 2022 as an intern while
            studying at the National University of Mongolia. At first, when I
            started my studies, it seemed the subjects were particularly easy
            and there was plenty of free time for me to spare. Furthermore, I
            thought that just by studying at a university I may not be able to
            achieve my dreams, so I decided to become an intern here and gain as
            much as possible. Things were easy at times when I could handle
            given tasks swiftly in a few hours and discouraging when all I could
            finish after a day of coding was one task assigned. But in the end I
            realized that the field of IT was interesting and coding was what I
            liked to do and also a path to achieve my dream, so all my negative
            emotions quickly faded away. There are lots of pros and cons when
            working while studying at a university. For example, I started
            earning an income and controlling my financial aspects of my life.
            Another is I’m one step beyond compared to my peers as I’m gaining
            sufficient work experience in the “real world”. In Mongolia, most
            people say that the times they spent studying at a university were
            the best times of their lives. But in my case, my time at university
            is passing by sitting in front of a computer screen.
